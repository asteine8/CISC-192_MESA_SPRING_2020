Assignment: 25 points
SIZES:
	Write a short C++ program which uses sizeof() to find out
	how many bytes all the basic data types occupy.

Use the code in sizes.cpp (below) as a starting point.  Extend it so
so that every native data type is covered.	

Here is an example C++ program which provides you an
example of how your code should look.

It starts with a "Comment Block" so others can maintain your code.
Read the code which is working, then simple common sense to combine that
example with each type of data.

#include <cstdio>
#include <cctype>
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cstdlib>

using namespace std ;

int main (int argc, char *argv[], char **env)
{
	cout << "Size of an int is: " << sizeof(int) << endl ;
	return EXIT_SUCCESS ;
} // main ends


====================================================

Now, here are the types of data:

	bool
	char
	short
	int
	long
	long long
	float
	double
	long double
	
	...and the pointers to each:
	int *
	long *

	and short,int,long,long long all may be prefaced with:
	unsigned
	or
	signed
	or
	register

	So you can figure out from looking at the program code
	that you can send each type to the sizeof() operator,
	and it will return a number, which is the size (in bytes)
	of that data type.  

	We ought to be able to get this one done in a lab session during class,
	since there's not a heavy Coffee Requirement here.
