Don't Guess when you can guarantee your grade by making sure.
YOU have total control over the grad you get from any "take home"
tests. 

Record your answers as a list of question numbers followed by the
letter of your answer choice.  Please don't edit and submit the
whole test file, the software won't be able to grade it,
Copy / paste and send in the body of an email message to the instructor.
No Attachments.

Remember how literal machines are.

1. C and C++ are languages in which the programmer writes readable
source code which is then compiled into an executable binary. (T/F)

2. Every C program must have one and only one function named MAIN()
   (T/F)

3. In a valid program, what will the following statement print:

   cout << ((2 + 1) < 4) << endl ;

    a. "1", because < means subtract
    b. "1", because 1 is true and 0 is false
    c. nothing, because the statement will cause an error
    d. "7", because < means add
    e. huh?

4. Preprocessor directives take effect at

    a. pre-compile time
    b. run time 
    c. lunch time
    d. edit time
    e. no answer can be certain 

5. The character '\n' causes the display of text to skip to the next line. (T/F).

6. The files which " #include <> " provides are human-readable text. (T/F).

7. C++ statements end with a ';' (semicolon). (T/F).

8. When a variable is defined inside of a { } block, it cannot be seen
   or changed from outside that block. (T/F).

9. If we call a function with the statement blotch(blue, green)
         what purpose do blue and green serve?

     a. they are "arguments" we're passing to the function blotch()
	  	
     b. they are the addresses of the function and the calling
     program
	  	
     c. they are the addresses of the variables which  we want
     blotch() to be able to access and/or modify. 

     d. they are the addresses of library routines needed by the
     function.

10. The source code for one C++ function cannot contain the source code
for another ("nested") C++ function. (T/F).

11. Which is true?
     a. One C++ function can call another C++ function.
     b. Only main() can call other functions().

12. A C/C++ function can only return one value (unless it returns a
pointer to an array). (T/F).

13. The C language is contained in C++. (T/F).

14. cout and printf:
    a. allow programs to talk to users
    b. allow users to provide information to programs

15. The Order of Execution (simplified) is:
    a. Assignment, Relational, Function Call
    b. Arithmetic, Assignment, Relational
    c. Arithmetic, Relational, Assignment
    d. Relational, assignment, Arithmetic
    e. Assignment, Relational, Arithmetic

16. A variable:
    a. always occupies 4 bytes
    b. can contain values of any type
    c. cannot have its contents changed once a value is assigned
    d. must be > 0
    e. none of these

17. In building Unix, C was used for the kind of work that had
previously only been done with Assembly Language.(T/F).

18. The code:
    int x = 9 ;
    cout << ++x ;

will print:
     a. 10 
     b. 9 
     c. 8
     d. 1
     e. error

19. How many bytes are taken up by 'C' and "C" respectively?
    a. 1, 1
    b. 2, 2
    c. 1, 2
    d, 2, 1
    e. none of these

20. Which of these arrays takes up more memory space on buffy?

    a. int a[5] ;
    b. long [2] ;
    c. char  s[81] = {"Oh, woe!"} ;
    d. int * ip[2] ;
    e. impossible to tell

21. On Buffy, when you don't use "-o" with cc or g++, the default name for
the executable is "a.out". (T/F).

22. C was developed from the BASIC language in 1970. (T/F).

23. Once you've fixed the compiler errors, the program is guaranteed
    to perform properly. (T/F).

24. The "char" type is really just a very small float. (T/F).

25. The Internet spread as fast as it did because Unix was written in
    C instead of Assembler. (T/F).
